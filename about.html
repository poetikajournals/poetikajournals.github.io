		Hello!
		<br><br>
		Thank you for visiting my little corner of the web.
		<br>
		I am a self-taught bookbinder in Texas, creating uniquely made, hand-bound journals for your creative needs.
		My bookbinding journey began about two years ago, sparked by a longing for a safe haven in which to express my thoughts.
		Without any luck finding a journal that encapsulated my personal essence, i decided to create my own, and that quickly evolved into a passionate endeavor.
		<br><br>
		Ever since I was a little girl, concealing my deepest thoughts and emotions between the furtive borders of a journal was an imperative aspect of my survival.
		To write, for me, is to self-analyze; to gain an awareness through the act of translating the subconscious into words only our truest self can understand;
		to remember that which we are afraid to forget; to express the darkness with which we only dance in the dark; to create; to survive.
		<br><br>
		Needless to say, bookbinding became an integral part of my life's journey.
		The provision of hand-bound journals to kindred creative spirits, dreamers, and fervently poetic souls alike is nothing short of a dream fulfilled.
		My purpose in crafting these journals is to gift to you a momentary respite, an inexhaustible source of inspiration to document the unspoken, or to illustrate the vivid sea of emotion within.
		<br><br>
		Whether you are writing lists, poetry, quotes close to your heart, or random musings, I hope my hand-bound notebooks offer you a sense of lightness and relief from the sometimes overwhelming feelings of our external world.
		I appreciate you taking the time to look around my site.
		<br><br>
		With love and gratitude,
		<br>always,
		<br>Allyssa
