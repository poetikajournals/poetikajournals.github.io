	Hello!
	<br><br>
	Thank you for visiting my little corner of the web.
	I am a self-taught bookbinder creating uniquely made, hand-bound journals for your creative needs.
	I remember writing in diaries since I was a little girl- concealing my deepest thoughts and emotions between the furtive borders of a journal.
	To write is to self-analyze; to gain an awareness through the act of translating the subconscious into words only our truest self can understand;
	to remember that which we are afraid to forget; to express the darkness with which we only dance in the dark.
	<br><br>
	Needless to say, bookbinding became an integral part of my life's journey, forever committed to the art of perpetual creation.
	The provision of hand-bound journals to kindred creative spirits, dreamers, and fervently poetic souls alike is nothing short of a dream fulfilled.
	My purpose in crafting these journals is to bestow upon you a momentary respite, an inexhaustible source of inspiration to document what words may
	fail to convey openly, or to illustrate the vivid tapestry of emotion that resides within.
	Whether it's writing lists, poetry, quotes close to your heart, drawings, or random musings, I hope my hand-bound notebooks offer you a sense
	of lightness and relief from the sometimes overwhelming feelings of our external world. I appreciate you taking the time to look around my site.
	<br><br>
	With love and gratitude,
	<br>always,
	<br>Allyssa
