				Since my journals are made-to-order, I do not offer returns.
				However, I am open to constructive feedback which you can leave via Etsy or by email at <a class="content-link" href="mailto:poetikajournals@outlook.com" title="Open Default Mail Application" target="_blank" rel="noreferer noopener">poetikajournals@outlook.com</a>.

			<div class="faq-answer">
				Each vessel is meticulously and lovingly made by my hands alone, from beginning to end.
				Each signature is reduced in size by folding and cutting, and each text block is stitched together using waxed
				linen thread after being individually awl-punched. I also cut each piece of bookcloth, leather and book board myself,
				glue everything together, and add embellishments or pyrographed elements.
