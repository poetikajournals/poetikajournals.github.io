		<div class="faq-question">Do you make all the journals at Poetika Journals?</div>
		<div class="faq-answer">
			Each vessel is meticulously and lovingly made by my hands alone, from beginning to end.
			Each signature is reduced in size by folding and cutting, and each text block is stitched together using waxed
			linen thread after being individually awl-punched. I also cut each piece of bookcloth, leather and book board myself,
			glue everything together, and add embellishments or pyrographed elements.
